'Plank menus are slice-based menus, where the menu item slices are called "planks".
'There are few requirements in how the slices are organised into a tree. There of lots
'of slices with different roles:
'
'1. A slice ps.m which is the root of the subtree for the menu; arbitrary other slices
'can exist in this tree aside from the ones below.
'
'2. An optional Scroll slice, which is scrolled automatically to the selected plank if
'it's a descendent. Planks can exist outside of it, as extra buttons outside the
'scrollable list.  The first Scroll slice in the tree is used.
'
'3. Zero or more 'list parent' slices for new planks (can be the root). Should normally be
'a Grid or Layout slice, so its childen are positioned automatically. This is specified
'by lookup code to plank_menu_append and plank_menu_clear; also typically passed as a
'pointer to functions such as plank_menu_arrows.
'These is just a place that new plank slices are created; planks don't have to all
'share this parent and can even be reparented out of it afterwards.
'
'4. Planks are the actual menu items. A plank should have the lookup code SL_PLANK_HOLDER
'whatever its type. Planks can be anywhere in the slice tree below ps.m (except a
'descendent of another plank!) Planks may be either created manually (e.g. for fixed
'extra selectable buttons like "New Game", or by thingbrowser's create_thing_plank()
'method), or created by calling plank_menu_append.
'
'5. Plank 'prototypes', which are cloned to create new planks if using plank_menu_append.
'Prototypes are usually template slice children of the list parent slice, but can also be
'stored in a separate file loaded with load_plank_from_file, or just any old slice.
'
'6. Descendants of a plank slice can have lookup code SL_PLANK_MENU_SELECTABLE if their
'styles should change depending on selection state. Call set_plank_state to call the
'state_callback on all SL_PLANK_MENU_SELECTABLE slices.  The default callback can modify
'Text and Rectangle slices.
'
'This module doesn't create any of these slices except planks from prototypes.
'You need to supply all the other slices yourself.
